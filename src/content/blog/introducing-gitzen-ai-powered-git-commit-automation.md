# Introducing Gitzen: The Future of Git Commit Automation

Are you tired of spending precious development time crafting the perfect commit message? Meet **Gitzen**, a groundbreaking AI-powered command-line tool that revolutionizes how developers interact with Git repositories. 

## What Makes Gitzen Special?

Gitzen isn't just another Git helper â€“ it's an intelligent assistant that understands your code changes and generates meaningful commit messages automatically. The tool integrates seamlessly with popular AI providers like OpenAI and Google Gemini, bringing enterprise-grade artificial intelligence directly to your development workflow.

## Four Core Commands That Transform Your Workflow

### ðŸš€ `gitzen start` - One-Time Setup
The interactive configuration wizard that gets you started in minutes. It guides you through:

- **Template Selection**: Choose from Conventional Commits, Angular, or Commitlint formats 
- **AI Model Selection**: Pick from GPT-4, GPT-4o, or Google Gemini models 
- **Language Configuration**: Support for 9 languages including English, Spanish, French, German, and more 
- **Message Length**: Customize commit message size from 16-120 characters 
- **API Key Setup**: Secure configuration for your chosen AI provider

### ðŸ§  `gitzen commit` - Smart Single Commits
Analyzes your staged changes and generates contextually relevant commit messages. The process:

1. Reads your staged changes using `git diff --cached` 
2. Sends the diff to your configured AI model
3. Generates a professional commit message following your chosen template
4. Asks for confirmation before committing

**Usage:**
```bash
git add .
gitzen commit
```

### ðŸ“¦ `gitzen batch` - Intelligent Multi-Commit Automation
The most powerful feature - automatically groups your unstaged changes into logical commits.  Here's how it works:

1. **Analyzes Unstaged Changes**: Scans all modified files in your working directory  
2. **AI-Powered Grouping**: Uses structured AI responses to group related files by purpose and functionality
3. **Generates Commit Plan**: Creates appropriate commit messages for each logical group
4. **Sequential Execution**: After your approval, automatically stages and commits each group 

**Usage:**
```bash
# Make multiple changes across different files
gitzen batch
# Review the proposed commit groups
# Approve and watch automatic commits happen
```

### ðŸ“Š `gitzen summarize` - Comprehensive Change Analysis
Get detailed insights into all your modifications before committing.  Features:

- Analyzes both staged and unstaged changes
- Explains WHAT changed and WHY it's relevant
- Supports language override with `-l` or `--lang` flag
- Perfect for code reviews and documentation

**Usage:**
```bash
gitzen summarize
gitzen summarize -l es  # Spanish summary
gitzen summarize --lang french
```

## Technical Implementation

### AI Integration
Gitzen supports multiple AI providers through a unified interface:
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo models
- **Google**: Gemini 2.5 Flash and 2.0 Flash models

### Git Operations
The tool performs safe Git operations through Node.js child processes:
- Reads diffs using `git diff` commands
- Stages files with `git add`
- Creates commits with `git commit -m`
- Validates repository status before operations

### Configuration Management
All settings are stored in a local `gitzen.config.json` file: 

```json
{
  "language": "en",
  "template": "conventional",
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "size": "36â€“50 characters",
  "provider": "openai"
}
```

## Installation & Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g gitzen

# Run setup wizard
gitzen start

# Start using immediately
git add .
gitzen commit
```

## Real-World Workflow Transformation

**Before Gitzen:**
1. Make changes across multiple files
2. Manually stage related files
3. Struggle to write meaningful commit messages
4. Repeat for each logical change
5. End up with inconsistent commit history

**With Gitzen:**
1. Make all your changes
2. Run `gitzen batch`
3. Review AI-generated commit plan
4. Approve and get professional commit history automatically

## Why Developers Choose Gitzen

- **Time Savings**: Eliminate the mental overhead of writing commit messages
- **Consistency**: Professional, standardized commit messages across your team
- **Intelligence**: AI understands your code context, not just file names
